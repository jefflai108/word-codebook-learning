# debug why acc doesn't go up 

0. retrain all models as i accidentally set dev to train 
1. cross-entropy with temperateure scaling? Alternatively predict soft cluster distance via KL 
2. check predicted classes --> load the trained model, run infernece and check acc. 
3. draw up an illustartion of my approach and show to Liming and Surabh
